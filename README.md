## Workflow

1. To access the data, first I retrieved the names of all types of equipment displayed on the page, clean and store them into a list.
2. Then, I lopped to access the 3 main characteristics of each model from the selected equipment - that are exposed in the page.
3. After having the information in a Dataframe, I started my Data Cleaning and Feature Organization.
4. With adequate data, I enabled access to MySQL and created the excel file.
5. To go further, I accessed the page of each model from all the types of equipment with Selenium, where I needed to click to 'expand' the information. 
6. I looped trou all the pages retrieving and storing (concat) the information into a data frame.
